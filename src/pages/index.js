                    <div>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</div><br />
                    <div>I am a web developer who went from disliking code to enjoying it tremendously. Early on i had little passion for coding, but eventually found the satisfaction in creating with my own hands.</div><br />
                    <div>I live and work in Stockholm and have spent quite a few years as various administrative and supportive roles within IT, but eventually came to a point where i wanted something more creative.</div><br />
                    <div>Problem solving has become the core of what i do professionally, i only recently shifted that focus from peoples technical issues, to understanding javascript instead!</div><br />
                    <div>I have always had a deep love for video games of every kind, along with working out in various ways. Its all about balance for the mind and body!</div>
